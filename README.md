# Codebreaker - Wordle Clone

Codebreaker is based off a childhood boardgame called mastermind in which two players take turns to guess each others secret code. The code is made from 5 out of the 8 possible coloured pegs and the aim is to guess what 5 colours your opponant has picked. You get feedback after each guess in which you can improve your guess next time. This game is singleplayer as the opponant is the computer however in the future I hope to add a two player mode.

Me and my girlfriend love playing this board game hence the reason I have digitialising it.


I have coded this project in react using typescript and a flask api backend.
